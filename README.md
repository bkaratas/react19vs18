# React 18 vs React 19 — Form Handling Comparison

A beautifully designed, side-by-side demo showcasing the evolution of form handling between **React 18** and **React 19**, with a focus on new hooks such as `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`, and `useOptimistic`.

---

## 📈 Overview

This project demonstrates how React 19's experimental form APIs simplify code and improve user experience compared to the traditional methods used in React 18.

You can explore:

* **Legacy Approach**: Classic form submission via state and page refresh (`/legacy`)
* **Modern Approach**: Optimistic UI updates and hook-based state management (`/modern`)
* **Comparison Mode**: React 18 and React 19 rendered side-by-side for visual and behavioral comparison (`/compare`)

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Fully Responsive UI** with Tailwind CSS
* **Animated transitions & modern design**
* **Explanation boxes** for each React 19 hook
* **Comparison table** showing usage and behavior differences
* **Demo Feedback Forms** for live experimentation

---

## 🙌 Why This Project?

React 19 introduces new primitives for form control that reduce boilerplate and improve UX. This project demonstrates these differences not only in code but in actual behavior, which can be useful for:

* Teaching React 19's new features
* Comparing ergonomics
* Building real-world, modern UI demos
* Showcasing transitions on LinkedIn or your portfolio
